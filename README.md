The projects implements symmetric encrypt / decrypt functions with algorithm built through Intel assembly, for discovering purposes

- Encryption must use external or self generated key.
- Decryption execution must be insignificant.
- Crypto functions must work for big and little endian.
- Crypto functions must work on i384 and x64.
- Use of Intel assembly

The possible implementation are the following :

- [Brian Gladman's AES algorithms](https://github.com/BrianGladman/aes)
- [XTEA algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTEA)
- [Caesar cipher encryption algorithm](https://medium.com/@maneeshap/caesar-cipher-encryption-algorithm-using-assembly-7699f5ab73c)
- RC6 [here](https://tinycrypt.wordpress.com/2015/12/15/rc6-block-cipher/) and [here](https://modexp.wordpress.com/2018/02/04/arm-crypto/)
- Very basic [shit](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/264491/Huo-Encryption-Decryption-Assembly-Program) but nice for introduction, use no key
- [Blowfish](http://www.unige.ch/medecine/nouspikel/ti99/blowfish.htm)
- [Polymorphic engines](https://www.pelock.com/articles/polymorphic-encryption-algorithms) encryption algorithms

Keywords:

- Cipher: algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.
- AES: [Advanced Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#Definitive_standards), is a specification for the encryption
- Block cipher: deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks, with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a symmetric key.
- There are two basic types of Encryption
    Symmetric. It uses same key for encryption and Decryption.
    Asymmetric. It uses two different keys(public and private) to encrypt and decrypt.

We decide here to implement **RC6** algorithm.

## Build

Build requires **nasm >= 2.11**. Actually build works only on osx.
Build generates `libww_crypto.so` into `./build` directory.

## Test

During compilation, binary test is provided at `./build/test`.

On OSX, just run `./build/test`
On Linux platform, run `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=build/ ./build/test`

## GDB

Example on how to use GDB to debug library.

```
gdb
set environment LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build # Only for shared librarys
set disassembly-flavor intel            # Set syntax as x86 assembly
file test_X                             # Debug the file test_X
run
b <function1>                           # Set a breakpoint on <function1> 
...
b <function1>
run
c                                        # Keep running to the next breakpoint
c
info registers rdi rsi rax rbx rcx       # Gives infos on bunch of registers
make re                                 # You can direclty run shell commands from GDB
...
```

## LLDB

Example on how to use LLDB to debug library on osx.
All LLDB doc is [here](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/map.html).

```
lldb
settings set target.x86-disassembly-flavor intel            # Set syntax as x86 assembly
file test_X                             # Debug the file test_X
run
b <function1>                           # Set a breakpoint on <function1> 
...
b <function1>
run
c                                        # Keep running to the next breakpoint
c
register read rdi rsi rax rbx rcx       # Gives infos on bunch of registers
platform shell make re                  # Run shell command with platform shell <command> <param1> <param2> ...
...
```
